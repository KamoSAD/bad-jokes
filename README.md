# Bad Joke Generator

## Introduction

> This simple website just generates bad jokes from an array of about 90 bad jokes. It displays them on the screen and logs them out.

## Markdown, Styling and Programming

> Plain Vanilla Javascript was used. HTML was used for the markdown and CSS for some basic styling. Built for understanding importing variables, Math.floor() and Math.random().

## Other Things

> The array of jokes was taken from [here.](https://github.com/AlekEagle/dadbot/blob/master/lists.json)

> Literally just a bad website, don't pay attention.
